                                    "It you want a good clean job done then Tonyâs your man.  He designed and fitted my new bathroom last year in 2014.  He was very good at problem solving (which often occurs when dealing with old plumbing) and takes pride in doing a good job.  As a result the old bathroom has been completely transformed and is a pleasure to use."

Tony helped me find ways to maximise the limited space I had for the new kitchen suggesting possible layouts and designs.â¨The quality of his work was high and, two years into having the work done, the units still look as new. I found him as good on his tiling skills.â¨I found Tony trustworthy and reliable, clean and organised in his work. â¨I would use him again in the future."

                                    "For the last 5 years we have used the services of Tony. We have always found him to be very helpful and friendly and no job is too big or too small.
                                    Tony has installed and mended many things in our house. He has built and installed our kitchen which also included rebuilding a supporting frame for our kitchen cabinets.
                                    Wood flooring, leaking taps, leaking bath, leaking toilet, removal of our radiators for decorating and even installing our curtain poles.

                                    Tony is our go to man for all our house problems and needs, as my Husband doesn't do DIY so he is my Godsend.
                                    I personally cannot recommend Tony highly enough his work is always of the highest standard and the finish is impeccable."

His skills covered everything from the design and project management through strip everything out, fully installing two bathrooms and kitchen, overseeing the electrical work and joinery. His advice was invaluable in choosing the fixtures and fittings along with recommending the finishing touches. His work was of the highest standard along with his attention to detail and dedication. We intend to have a number of future projects in which Tony will have a significant role to play. We couldnât recommend him enough."
