                     I have extensive experience in property renovation and project management. If you are buying a house to make a home or for an investment, I can manage the whole project by overseeing and working with other professional trades to ensure the project is completed in a satisfactory manner.

                    The property was in need of a complete modernisation. I was contracted to project manage the refurbishment,
                    undertaking and completing much of the work myself and in addition overseeing a team of skilled tradesmen.The
                    property was fully re-wired and the ceilings were lowered to incorporate LED down lighting. A new boiler and central heating system were installed. Solid oak doors were fitted throughout. 
                    Furthermore, a new kitchen, with solid quartz worktops and a tiled floor were installed, a new bathroom fully tiled floor to ceiling and a new ensuite with a walk in shower. The apartment was fully decorated and a quality carpet fitted
                    throughout.

                        electrical work and joinery. His advice was invaluable in choosing the fixtures and fittings along with recommending the finishing touches. His work was of the highest standard along with his attention to detail and dedication. We intend to have a number of future projects in which Tony will have a significant role to play. We couldnâ€™t recommend him enough."

                    Renovation of a two bed terrace house in Clayton, Bradford.
                </p>
                <p class="col-2-text">
                    The property had been very neglected and needed updating. It was fully rewired, the plumbing was completely
                    replaced, a central heating system installed and it was fully plastered. A new bathroom was fitted with a separate shower cubicle and wall tiling.
                    Stud walls were assembled to incorporate the new fitted kitchen as the original one was too small. The house was fully decorated and a new carpet fitted. The exterior was tidied up and painted ready for re sale.
